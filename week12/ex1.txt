NOTE: I'm working with the machine AlpineLinux from bellard.org
Link: https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192
The reason for this is that I have MacOS 11, which does not have
/proc at all and implements everything using sysctl.
That is why, for example, it may not work for you.
"You did not copy all shared libraries" for example, is wrong, since
I did, because Alpine I use has only /lib and no other shared libraries directories.

Explanation:
dma1   - Direct Memory Access Controller. It is used to provide temporary
access to RAM without the need to use to CPU to increase data transfer speed.
pic1   - Programmable Interrupt Controller. It is used to help a CPU to handle 
interrupt requests. For example, when we have multiple interrupts, we can safely
ignore one of them, while working with the other, since PIC will ensure we 
resolved all existing interrupts.
timer1 - 16 bit timer used to generate timing accurate interrupts.
