Knowing the algorithm used for paging it is relatively simple to construct reference
sequence to break or explot it.
For example, if we want to decrease the ratio, then we should try to ask every time
for a new previosly not used reference:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, .....
And we are out of references we can just start repeating this sequence periodically.
To increase the ratio it is enough to simply request the existent frames:
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ......
