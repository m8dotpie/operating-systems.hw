Virtual addressing is an abstraction hiding actual
physical locstion of data from the caller. Advantage
of this idea is that we can negotiate the lack of
physical memory, by creating an illusion of enough
memory, using the ordinary storage for swapping
the components instead of keeping everythin in
main memory.
