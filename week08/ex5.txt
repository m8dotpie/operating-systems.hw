Virtual addressing allows us to abstract from the real numbers
and allow processes to have some invariants. For example, every
process might think that it's address space starts at the location
of 0 and operate like it has some memory from 0 till some limit.
Of course, it could not be possible with several processes, since
if every process will have address 0, than they will interfere.
Virtual addressing allows mapping to the physical memory, making
such an illusion an simplifies memory abstraction.
